Example code written throughout the Google Machine Learning [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal) provided on the [Google Developers](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers) YouTube channel, although it was released back in 2016 they recently published a new [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDRbO9a6XPU) however, it hasn't been added to the playlist just yet.

After recipe #5 all the code provided can be found within the video description, otherwise, I shall try my best to keep it up to date here. ✌️
